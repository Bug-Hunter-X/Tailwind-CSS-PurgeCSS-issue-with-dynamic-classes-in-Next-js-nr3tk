This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue is that Tailwind's purging process might not correctly identify and remove unused CSS classes, leading to larger-than-necessary CSS bundles. This can happen when using dynamic class names or complex component structures that Tailwind's static analysis struggles to fully understand.
